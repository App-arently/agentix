# Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Code Generation

## Overview

This project is an agentic AI framework designed to autonomously generate code for web applications based on user-provided project descriptions. It leverages advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Cohere to interpret requirements and produce code for frontend, backend, and database components.

## Features

- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks down project descriptions into actionable tasks.
- **Specialized Agents**: Uses specialized agents for frontend, backend, and database code generation.
- **Ensemble AI Models**: Utilizes multiple AI models to generate and aggregate responses.
- **Code Validation**: Validates generated code using linters like ESLint and Flake8.
- **Version Control**: Manages code integration using GitPython.
- **Dashboard Interface**: Provides a real-time dashboard to monitor progress and provide feedback.
- **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Uses Celery and Redis for task queue management.
